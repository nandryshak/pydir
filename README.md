# PYDIR
### Generate static HTML pages for directory listings.
This Python Script will scan a given directory and all it contains, recursively, and within each of those directories (including the root) create a directory listing HTML page that not only looks nice but is completely static, removing the need for often bandwidth-intensive client-side handlers. Not only that, but it also has support for custom styles, so no more of those ugly default Apache directory listings.

# Usage
`python3 app.py /path/to/root/working/directory/`
You may use `.` or any relative naming to describe the directory.
Please note that the program will write files to the chosen directory.

# Configuration
Config files coming soon.
